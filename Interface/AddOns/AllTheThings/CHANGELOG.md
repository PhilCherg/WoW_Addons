## [SL-2.4.1](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.4.1) (2021-08-22)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.4.0...SL-2.4.1) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

Nothing groundbreaking this time, mostly just fixes and cleanup of old error reports.

### Notable changes:

- Fixes WoD craftables, where the base version is obtainable, but upgraded versions are unobtainable. **Please post in #errors if anything unusual has happened due to this change since it is quite drastic (i.e. unobtainable versions of Items showing up again as available, etc.)**
- Fixes some Covenant quests
- Fixed some PvP ensembles/items
- Fixes to Arathi Basin quests
- Moved Classic PvP into appropriate PvP->Battlegrounds section
- Classic PvP & Cataclysm replica Rated Battleground titles are now split
- Fixed BfA PvP mounts
- Modified 'Source Locations' logic to always include any obtainable sources, but properly mark them if from a source which does not meet the user's current filters. Additionally, the proper unobtainable icon will always display on unobtainable Sources, even when they meet the user's filters or when in Debug mode
- Fixed (probably) Azerite Armor caches again ??
- Various fixes
