### Reportable errors now play a sound (if enabled) ðŸ””

### Notable changes:

- Tracking indicators should only show if the group is considered 'trackable'. Achievement headers within Raids no longer show the 'saved' checkmark (as it's confusing since that indicator is typically used to show if your character is saved to the instance).
- Fixed Legion Emissary quests in `/attwq`.
- Common Boss Drop with specified Creatures will show individual Creatures under popout Sources.
- Continued consolidation with Classic ATT:
  - Blasted Lands
  - Dun Morogh + (added a bunch of white collectible items)
  - Fixed timelines here and there
  - Updated the format of the Honor gear for Classic and TBC PVP
  - Updated the format of the Burning Crusade Gladiator Gear to not nest items within the ensembles (not finished yet) and added timeline data
- Harvested more 9.2.5 data, this should fix filtering of new Things.
- Other fixes.
